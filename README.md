# Implementation of GMM-HMM for speech Recognition using hmmlearn python package.
Forked from https://github.com/jayaram1125/Single-Word-Speech-Recognition-using-GMM-HMM- I've refactored code and added some more stuff. 
Trained models are in models/ directory, If you want to use them see example predict_google.py. You can record your own voice using record_audio.py
